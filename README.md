Everywhere Dash:
An attempt to run accurate Geometry dash on different platforms.
This works with scratch but not the griffpatch one, this one is a 1:1 exact and accurate replica of the real game, in scratch with some modifications from turbowarp!
Play: https://everywheredash.github.io , https://everywheredash.vercel.app/ , https://geometry-dash-online.vercel.app/

This is still in beta! If you find a bug or suggest something please put in in the issues tab :)
