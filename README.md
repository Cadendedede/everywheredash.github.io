Everywhere Dash:

An attempt to run accurate Geometry dash on the web to play anywhere, everywhere! 

Created by Sotospro24.

This works with scratch but not the griffpatch one, this one is a 1:1 exact and accurate replica of the real game, in scratch with some modifications from turbowarp!

v1.0 is released!!! Enjoy! :) If there are any bugs please put them in the issues tab.

Play: https://everywheredash.github.io , https://everywheredash.vercel.app/ , https://geometry-dash-online.vercel.app/
(for wide screen add "/wide/index.html" at the end: https://everywheredash.github.io/wide/index.html)

Big thanks to Kouzeru in scratch for the physics!
